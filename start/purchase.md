```text
1. I will not offer help to the one who didn't purchase the plugin

2. Due to the busy study, I can probably only respond & try to solve issues once every week.
Therefore make sure the issue you create provide enough information and links do not expire for a period

3. I cannot complete all the feature requests, some requests which are irrelevant
or too hard to realize will be decline or put into low-priority

Please understand :)
